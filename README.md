This project is by Bryce Hodson, Horacio Valencia, and Spencer Lee in their collaborative submission to Hack Arizona 2016.

The project builds upon open source OCR android technologies, mainly tesseract-ocr and android-ocr by Robert Theis.

Features added to the OCR technology were redirection of recognized text to POST to a server signaling when a mailing package had arrived at the organization and was scanned.
